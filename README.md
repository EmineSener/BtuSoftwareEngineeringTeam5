# BreakBored | Personality Free Time Application 
```
BreakBored is a personality free time appliaction.
It aims to ensure that users spend their free time as efficiently as possible.
Unlike other social media applications, it keeps users away from the negative effects of social media
by directing them only to useful content.
Since Breakbored is a completely user-oriented application, all the content it offers to users is specific to them.
It provides a personal experience for users by making continuous analyses.
```

## BreakBored | Description
```
BreakBored is a web application that users can access via a link.
They can only access the login page via the link and register or log in if they wish.
The home page of the application opens for a user who logs in, and BreakBored offers them a great experience.
BreakBored recommends content such as movies, music, and books to users so that they can spend their free time productively.
It makes these recommendations by analyzing the user's previous experiences in the application.
Each time the user logs in to the application, two different systems run in the background.
The first system tracks the user's activity on the home page, while the second system analyzes
the user's current experiences and determines what content will be shown to the user the next time they enter the application.
A new analysis is made every time the user logs in, and the application offers the user a unique experience each time.
BreakBored is completely user-specific. It not only recommends content to the user but also provides other analyses for them.
One of these is sentiment analysis. In the relevant section of the application homepage,
there is a system that helps detect the emotional state of the user. Moreover, this system makes analysis possible
with both text and images.
As a result of the analysis, the application makes recommendations to the user.
BreakBored offers users another analysis: program analysis.
If the user wishes, they can save their program and review the analysis made by BreakBored about their program.
